## License & Contribution

TechBoard is released under the **MIT License**, encouraging you to explore, modify, and adapt the code as you see fit. Feel free to fork the repository and give it a star!

> [!NOTE]
> As a portfolio project, TechBoard showcases a broad range of features that would typically be found in a production environment. However, some aspects have been slightly simplified or adjusted for demonstration purposes. These include:
>
> * **Password Recovery:** While password reset functionality is present, the reset link currently appears in the IDE's console for ease of demonstration. In a production setting, this would be delivered via email.
> * **User Email Validation:** Email validation has been streamlined for the portfolio context. 
> * **Database Scalability:** For this project, SQLite is used. A production application would typically utilize a more scalable database solution.
